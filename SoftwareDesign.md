My favorite software design that I learned about this week was Observer or Publish/Subscribe. I like it because it is straight forward. Almost like creating prototypes in JavaScript where the object's state can be changed and the dependents of said object will be notified and updated automatically. 

It would be very beneficial when creating a game and the object in question's state needs to change any dependents of that object that the game then needs will be updated automatically without the need of having to go in manually and change everything.

Singleton Overuse is the anti pattern I chose to write about because all classes that have references to themselves (or their base class) are potential Singletons. Making it a very dangerous anti pattern to use.
